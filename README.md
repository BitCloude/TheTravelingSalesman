Trips and Expense Add/Edit activities:
Trips:
-To save the trip/expense you wish to add the client name must be inputted and the start date("From") must proceed the ending date("To")
-To save, tap the check-mark at the top right corner of the screen, or tap the ("Add Expense") button. Pressing back aborts the process.
-Attempting to add a photo automatically saves the trip/expense, thus the above conditions must be satisfied first to add a photo.
-To save the photo and any data added after the automatic save mentioned above, a manual save must still be performed, described above.
-The display can be oriented horizontally for better photo viewing, however this must be done after saving the photo and returning to the trip/expense.
-You can delete the photo by tapping the black('x') button on the corner of the added photo.
Expenses:
-The only notable difference is the "+" button next to the "Select A Trip" autocomplete input.
